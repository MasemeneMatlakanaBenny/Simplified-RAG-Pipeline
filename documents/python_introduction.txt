Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python’s design philosophy emphasizes writing clear, logical code that is easy to understand and maintain.

Because Python uses an English-like syntax and avoids unnecessary complexity, it is often the first programming language learned by beginners, while still being powerful enough for professionals building large-scale systems.
